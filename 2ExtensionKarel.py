Karel moves through holes in columns that are one corner separate, that makes a hall. She pick up the coins (beepers) and put it down
at the finish line, that function as a scoreboard.
The finish line is mark in orange with beepers, that Karel also picks.
The coins are just at the holes. Holes are 1*1.

Models of this worlds are 2ExtensionKarel and 2ExtensionKarel1.
The world must have a orange finish line. The beepers should be right in the gaps
