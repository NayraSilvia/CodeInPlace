Karel moves in the world searching black corners. When she finds one, she paints a watermelon
She paints randomly black corners at the beginning. Those must be separated by at least 16 corners in width and 9 in height.
She finally paints all watermelons.
Karel's initial position is (1,1) and faces east.

Models world for this are 6ExtensionKarel and 6ExtensionKarel1. 6ExtensionKarel2 has already black corners, that makes 
overlapping watermelon pattern.
